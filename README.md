## Introduction
The Spring Boot Application is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework. It serves as a foundation for developing web applications with minimal configuration. The application follows the convention-over-configuration principle, which allows developers to quickly build robust and scalable applications.

## Features
- Easy setup and configuration
- Built-in server for running the application
- Dependency management using Maven
- Automatic configuration based on sensible defaults
- RESTful API support
- Database integration (e.g., JDBC, JPA)
- Security features (e.g., authentication, authorization)
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

## Getting Started
To get started with the Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-application.git
```
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Install Maven build tool on your system.
4. Build the application using the following command:
```
mvn clean install
```
5. Once the build is successful, you can run the application using the following command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
6. The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage
The Spring Boot application provides a starting point for developing your web application. You can extend and modify it to fit your specific requirements. Here are some key files and directories in the repository:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code for the application.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains the configuration files and static resources.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project configuration file that manages dependencies and build settings.
- `application.properties`: Contains the application-specific configuration properties.

Feel free to explore and modify these files based on your project needs.

## Configuration
The configuration for the Spring Boot application is managed through the `application.properties` file. This file contains various properties that control the behavior of the application, such as database connection details, server port, logging settings, and more.

You can customize these properties to suit your environment and requirements. Additionally, you can also use profiles to manage different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, production).
